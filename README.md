# In the game Wordle, the user is trying to guess a secret five-letter word. 
# The user will type in a five-letter guess, and the computer will share information about how close the guess is to the actual answer.
# If a letter in the guess exactly matches a letter in the answer (same letter and correct position), the letter will be marked green.
# If a letter in the guess almost matches a letter in the answer (same letter, but incorrect position), the letter will be marked yellow.
# If a letter in the guess doesn’t match a letter in the answer (guessed letter doesn’t exist in answer), the letter will be marked red.
